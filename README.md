## Projects
### Apple plant trees disease detection using CNN and Sequential model
[Project Link](https://github.com/Abir0810/apple_trees_plant_dieases_prediction_using_Sequential_model_and_cnn)

Developed a deep learning model using CNN and Sequential model where there are many classifications for Apple plant tress disease. There are a lot of image data. After preprocessing those image data, we have developed a model where the model will identify the disease of the plant.
